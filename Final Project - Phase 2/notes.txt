Add an image map that links to two or more different pages. *new page w big minimal wallpaper anchoring 
to other section on same page

Chapter 10: Tables
Add a table that presents tabular data to the site.

Chapter 11: Forms - (mail page) (get method)
Add a form that lets the user enter first name, last name, email address, and comments along with Reset and 
Submit buttons. Of course, the data won’t be processed because there’s no client-side or server-side script 
for doing that. 

*create page for this and add method as well as form element (get, push, etc)*
However, the data should be submitted to a page that has a link back to the home page. 
Also, the data that is passed to the page should be visible in the URL for the page.
